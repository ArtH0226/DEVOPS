## Availability
- The period of time when a service is available
- Formula:
  - Availability = "Available for Use Time" / "Total Time”
- Common practice: Identify the level of availability by referring to the number of 9’s:
  - 99.99999999999% available means “11 9’s”
- Service Level Agreements (SLA’s)

## AWS Well-Architected Tool
