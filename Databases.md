# Databases

## What is a Database?
- Definition: A shared collection of related data used to support the activities of a particular organization
- Purpose: To a Sepcific piece (or group) of information quickly.
- Examples?
- Database Properties
  - A collection of data elements (facts) represnting real-world information
  - It is logical, coherent and internally consistent.
  - Well-designed, built and populated with data for a sepcific purpose. 
  - Each data item is stored in a field
  - A combination of fields makes up a table

## Benefits of a Databse
- Self-describing nature of a database system
- Insulation between program and data
- Support for multiple views of data 
- Sharing of data and multiuser system
- Control of data redundancy
- Data Sharing 
- Enforcement of integrity constraints
- Restriction of unauthorized access
- Data independence Transaction processing
- Provision for multiple views of data 
- Backup and recovery facilities

## Relational Databases
- Fundamental Concepts.
  - Relation
  - Table
  - Cloumn
  - Domain
  - Record
- Properties of a Tables
  - Distinct Name
  - No duplicate rows; each row is distinct
  - Entries in columns are atomic
  - Entries from cloumns are from the same domain based on their data type including: 
   - number (numeric, integer, float, smallint,...)
   - character (string)
   - date 
   - logical (true or flase)
  - Operations combingin different data types are disallowed
  - Each attribute has a distinct name
  - The sequence of coluimns is insignificant
  - The sequence of rows is insignificant

## Non-relational Databases
- Examples of non-relational databases:

## Query for Data
- There are ONLY FOUR BASIC commands for interacting with an SQL database. Can you figure out what they are?
- C.R.U.D - Create, Read, Update, Delete
- SELECT - to query data in the database
- INSERT - to insert data into a table
- UPDATE - to update data in a table
- DELETE - to delte data from a table

- SELECT
  - Ex: SELECT * FRP< dbo.Orders

  - EX: SELECT
