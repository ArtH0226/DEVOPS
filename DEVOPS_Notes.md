## The Big Picture
- Devops is a framewokr for a way of thinking and working
  - enables peopeles and teams to work ineffective ways
  - part of a cultural waeve that sahpes how and why we work
- Tools and culture are equally as important
- Not just another software development methodology
  - Methodology is important, but just a part
  - Cultural and interpersonal aspects are the big picture 

## DevOps Culture: Etsy
- Day 1, new engineers are used a laptop with:
  - A virtual machine
  - accounts and authorization for common github repos
  - standard tools and a guide for new hires
  - new engineers are paried with a current employee
- A local development and try servers used for testing changes
- High-trust, blameless environment where developers decide if code review is needed
  -continuous integreation
  
 ## DevOps culture: Facebook
 - facebook developers work independently doing small changes
 - Bug fix and internal code realsed twice a day 
  -larger changes for new freatures done weekley
 - release engineeres assess risk
 - A tool called gatekeeper isused to control feature releasese
   - Some features realsed to all
   - others to specific users

##Devops Culture:paypal

## Evoltuon of culture: old way
- teams often worked in a silo with minial collaboration
- projects were punted over the "wall"
- no responsibility so operations often cleaned up developments code

# Evolution of culture: dedvops way
- like AWS, devops is shared responsibility culture
  - Reduced silos and increase collaboration
  - Enable all to develop, test, deploy and monitor changes
- At Etsy, effective devops included
  -an organization that was willing to embrace change to affect how individuals work
  - accelerate business value
  - measure effects of change

# What is Devops
## Devops: what is it?
- Devops is a cultural movement for individuals and organizations
  - Changes how individuals think about their work
  - Values the diversity of work done
  - Supports intentional processes that accelerate the rate which businesses realize value
  - Measures the effect of social and technical chnage
 - Incorrectly thought of as just developers and operations
 
## A perscription for culture
- A perscription for culture where social structure and culture are intertwined

## The Devops Equation
- Describes what a succesful devops culture looks and acts
- Describes how these principles can be applied across a variety of organizations and environment 
  - No perscription for one true way of doing devops 
  - Can be applied to an entire organization beyond developers and operations personnel

## Devops as a folk model
- different groups and meanings lead to misunderstandings
  - a folk model is the human capacity to explain and predict the behavior and mental state of other people

## stories from the new view
- Devops lead to increased transparancy and trust within a team
- Devops instructs coworkers in how to avoid a costly mistake without having to directly experience it
- Devops increases thte time spent on solving new problems, allowing for more innovation

## The Devops compact
- a compact is usally a written document taht outlines how a team will operate with clear guideliens for processes
  - teams are made of people with mutual understanding
  - allows the team to work together, communicate and dynammically adjust to work towards goals

## history of Devops
- computers operaters wrere also developers
- focus was on hardware
  - It's not the machine, it's the operators
- Manual process
- Math majors called upon to become the computers

## the 1960s: Rise of software engineering
- President JFK set a challenge to land a person on the moon with the decade
- Margaret hamilton hired to write onboard flight software 
  - Coined the term of software engieneering
  - Created concept of prioriry displays for real time alerts
- Requirements gathering now included quality assurance list
  - Debugging all individual components
  - Testing individual components prior to assembly 
  - Integration testing 
- Management gave teams freedom and trust 

## the 1960s: advent of proprietary software and standardization
- in 1964 IBM announced the system/460 family 

## the 1960s beginnings of a global community
-early user groups began as a way to share ideas
  - decus, the digital equipment computers user's society was founded in 1961
  - unenix, and SAGE were gorups for systems administrorors
  - Lisa was started for large installation system administors
- companies still discouraged and forbidden knowledge sharing 

## 1970s age of the network
- organizations were silos that stymied collaboartion and communication
  - at the tie, company culture prevented this type of communication as it gave a competitive advantage

## The 1990s  age of the applications and the web
- the 1990s began the age of open source and we applications
  - -1991 the first webpage went live by tim berners-lee
  - - 1992 usenet post series Bastard operator from hell
  - -1994 php was realeased as a personal home page tool
  - -1995 apache HTTP server and mysql were released
- Anyone could create web applications and dynamic content
- Organizations had to be faster and flexible to stay competitive

## the 2000's growth of software developement 
-open source is a type of software where anyone can view and use the source code
  --can run on hardware that meets the requirements
  --lead to be less restricture for hardware
- proprietart is software/hardware taht owned by a company
  - AWS is a proprietary service provider
- Platforms like Twitter benefitted

## the 2000's: Agile Infrastructure
- Open source revolutionized software, agile infratstructure was also used to

## The 2000's: Rise of DevOps
- In 2009, confreences for devops when from 1 to 100s 
- Meetups and individual communciation has incrased
- Now high-performing devops organizations
    - Deploy code mroe frequently
    - Have fewer failures
    - Recover from those failures fsater
    - Have happier employees

## Four Pillars of Devops

## Pillar 1: collboration
- process of building toward a specific outcome through suppooring tinereaction adn the input of multipkle people
- guiding prinicple is the cooperation of stoware development and operations teams

## pillar 2: affinity
- affinity is the process of 
  - building interteam relationships 
  - navigating differeing goals or metrics
  - keeping the shared organization goal in mind
  - fostering empathy and learnning between different gorups
- allos devops teams to build a collective body of cultural and techncial knowledge within an organization

## Pillar 3: Tools
- tools are an accelerator for success or failure
- - drive change based culture
- imoprtant to understand how tools influcence issues
- - correct choice can improve communications, deployment, etc
- -incorreact choice can cost money and time

## pillar 4: scaling
- Scaling focuses on the process and privots in a lifecycle
-- Applications can grow and shirnk over time
-- Organizations can also change over time
- Technology behind organizations and applications need to allow for tehncial and cultrual fluctiations over time
